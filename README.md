# ZTMNews - Frontend
This repo is a front end you can use for [Coding_Challenge-15](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Coding_Challenge-15). If you are not comfortable in working with React, you are more than welcome to create your own front end, in which ever framework or languages you would like to. 

The endpoint you will need, if you decided to create your own front end it: http://162.243.169.202:3000/api/resources

## What inspired this challenge?
A small team of fellow students have been working on a system to extract all the resources in the #dev-resource channel of the ZTM Discord server into a databse. Where they can be presented on a frontend, Providing features such as upvoting and bookmarking the resource. So as a community we can create a collection of popular and useful resources.
