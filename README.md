# ZTMNews - Frontend
This repo is a frontend you can use for [Coding_Challenge-15](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Coding_Challenge-15). Keep in mind that this is a template for the challenge, however, you are more than welcome to build your own frontend website like this one that lists the API call to our massive endpoint with all of the resources. How you chose to build it is up to you. Plain JavaScript? Angular, React, Vue? Those all work! There are no guidelines other than: try and list all of these resources efficiently for a user. 

If you do not want to work on your own frontend, but rather focus on optimization and the performance part of the challenge alone, you can fork the repository and get started!

To run the project:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

The endpoint you will need, if you decided to create your own front end is: http://162.243.169.202:3000/api/resources

## What inspired this challenge?
A small team of fellow students have been working on a system to extract all the resources in the #dev-resource channel of the ZTM Discord server into a databse. Where they can be presented on a frontend, Providing features such as upvoting and bookmarking the resource. So as a community we can create a collection of popular and useful resources.
