# Rusty's Resources - Frontend
The aim of this project is to create a web app that will display all of the student submitted resources, from the #dev-resources channel and potentially other channels on the ZTM Discord server. A Discord bot will be responsible for automatically adding new resources to a database, with the possibility of manually triggering the addition of new resources from other channels.

The web app will be responsible for taking the data from the database via the Bots API and displaying it in a visually appealing manner. 

### Features:
- Reddit like upvoting/downvoting
